A submission into wacky files that converts the image into a .wav audio file and then back again



Ver 1:
After some research, I found that the simplest way to change the image uis by turning the image’s pixel bytes directly into raw audio sample values, plays them as sound, then reverses the mapping to turn the exact same numbers back into the image

So far I have found a way to make the image a loooong line of numbers of bits.

So far what I have mustered up granted it's really compact
Ver 2:

Added a auto open of the banana file, reduced code lines through some yt tutorials and placed all files in a auto generated folder!
